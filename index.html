    <h3>Outer Space Treaty :</h3>
    <div id="terms">
        <h3>“Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies”</h3>
        <p>The treaty is the foundation of international space law for signatory nations (108 in 2019). The treaty presents principles for space exploration and operation:
        <ul>
            <li>Space activities are for the benefit of all nations, and any country is free to explore orbit and beyond.</li>
            <li>There is no claim for sovereignty in space; no nation can “own” space, the Moon or any other body.</li>
            <li>Weapons of mass destruction are forbidden in orbit and beyond, and the Moon, the planets, and other celestial bodies can only be used for peaceful purposes.</li>
            <li>Any astronaut from any nation is an “envoy of mankind,” and signatory states must provide all possible help to astronauts when needed, including emergency landing in a foreign country or at sea.</li>
            <li>Signatory states are each responsible for their space activities, including private commercial endeavors, and must provide authorization and continuing supervision.</li>
            <li>Nations are responsible for damage caused by their space objects and must avoid contaminating space and celestial bodies.</li>
        </ul>
